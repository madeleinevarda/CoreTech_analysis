# Deep-Dive Insights

## Sales Trends 

**Overview:**

From 2019-2022, over 108K orders generated $28M in sales, with both metrics showing a 28% growth increase over this four-year period. Particularly noteworthy, sales surged dramatically by X% in 2020 during the onset of the pandemic, as consumer purchasing patterns pivoted sharply toward online ordering. However, this momentum did not sustain through 2021 and 2022, as trends in sales, average order value (AOV), and order count showed substantial declines by X%. Finding ways to maintain the value captured during 2020 and 2021 is key to continue towards sustained long term growth.

**Seasonality:**

Typically, February and October underperform compared to the preceding months, while December and January boast high average sales due to the holiday season. Notably, in 2020, March sales surged 50% over February, an anomaly not reflecting the usual trend from 2019-2022, where March generally sees a modest increase over February.

## Product Trends

Gaming monitors and laptops are the core of elist's revenue stream. While these categories historically account for approximately X% of total sales, 2021 stands out with an unprecedented concentration, reaching nearly X% of all transactions. Notably, headphone sales, which traditionally represent X% of revenue, were completely absent in 2021, potentially indicating either a data recording oversight or supply chain disruptions affecting product availability.

## Loyalty Program
In an aggregate of the past four years, the non-loyalty program generally outperformed the loyalty program. However, a closer look at the trends reveals that the loyalty program surpassed the non-loyalty program in total sales in 2021 and in Average Order Value (AOV) in 2022. Evidence suggests that the loyalty program's AOV has been steadily growing, whereas the non-loyalty program's AOV has shown more volatility.
