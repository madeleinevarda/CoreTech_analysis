# Deep-Dive Insights

## Sales Trends 

Seasonality: Typically, February and October underperform compared to the preceding months, while December and January boast high average sales due to the holiday season. Notably, in 2020, March sales surged 50% over February, an anomaly not reflecting the usual trend from 2019-2022, where March generally sees a modest increase over February.

## Loyalty Program
In an aggregate of the past four years, the non-loyalty program generally outperformed the loyalty program. However, a closer look at the trends reveals that the loyalty program surpassed the non-loyalty program in total sales in 2021 and in Average Order Value (AOV) in 2022. Evidence suggests that the loyalty program's AOV has been steadily growing, whereas the non-loyalty program's AOV has shown more volatility.
